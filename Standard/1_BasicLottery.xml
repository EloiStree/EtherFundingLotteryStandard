   Coded: oneperaddress: One address can only have one ticket. I allows to make lottery that are not design to rob participant but that can be "unfair" is there a bot in the pool
  WIP: oneperentry: One per valide entry allows to make lottery that are "fair" if you have bot or ai participating, but that risky for people that like "gambleing" to much.
  WIP: oneperentryamount: Convert all the amount the participant put in the lottery and convert it as some tickets. Same that oneperentry but too easy for big gambler
