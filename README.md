# Ether Funding Lottery Standard

Welcome to you. 

I have design an algorithm that allows anybody to organized a lottery to fund a goal or an organisation based On Ethereum.


With this alorighm, I provie a Unity project that allows anyone to verify the state of the lottery based on the initial parameter of it.


The organizer can decide of this initial parameter with his community and publish them on their website.
But it means that it can be change in the middle of contest if participants at not overwatching it.



This GitHub project are standard input data that won't change.
Depending on the "Input data" of the transaction or the "amount" in wei of the start transaction, the organized choose one of the standard and approve it.
 

PS: I am designing the standard on the amount of the transaction because I don't have the knoweldge yet to make it works with input data.   
If you want to help me on that: https://eloistree.page.link/discord   
(And because it makes it easy for the organizer)
